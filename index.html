<p>
Sworn translator specialised in legal and financial content. Analytical, inquisitive and detail-oriented. I take pride in applying my expertise to realise impeccable textual products, both individually as well as in client-specific teams.</p>
<p>
I have been registered in the Dutch Sworn Translators and Interpreters Registry under number 29246 since 2020 and have been actively performing sworn translations ever since, both manually and by means of computer-assisted translation tools. Since 2020, I have explicitly and intentionally worked in accordance with the relevant standards on translation quality (ISO 17100) and data security (ISO 27001).
</p>
<p>
Notarial instruments in the fields of corporate law and inheritance law are my bread and butter. I have also been responsible for translating the financial statements of several multi-million euro companies and investment funds for several years on end, as recurring clients.
</p>
<p>
I have played a key role in the winning of various tenders, including tenders for multiple leading universities of applied sciences in the Netherlands. Moreover, I have reviewed and corrected their pre-existing writing guides and terminology, all this in close consultation with said universities as clients.
</p>
<p>
As a by-product of coordinating the linguistic side of such collaborative efforts, I have also successfully taken on the role of translation content manager for such key clients in practice, providing and receiving feedback and coordinating terminology and style choices across client-specific teams consisting of up to five translators.
